# Sales-Dashboard

The objective for analyzing sales data is to gain insights that drive strategic decision-making and improve business performance. By evaluating sales trends over time, identifying top-selling products, and segmenting customers, we aim to enhance marketing efforts and boost customer retention. Additionally, we seek to forecast future sales to optimize inventory management and budget planning. Key performance metrics will be calculated to assess overall health, while regional comparisons will highlight growth opportunities. Ultimately, this analysis will support data-driven strategies that increase revenue, improve sales team performance, and measure the effectiveness of promotional campaigns.
